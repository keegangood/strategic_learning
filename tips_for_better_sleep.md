# Tips for Better Sleep

## 1. Establish a bedtime routine

A regular bedtime and a relaxing bedtime routine will help regulate our Circadian rythym and prepare our bodies to go to sleep. Stretching or meditating before bed can be useful.

## 2. Don't lie awake in bed

If we can’t fall asleep after 15 to 20 minutes, we should get out of bed and go into another room. While there, we should do something relaxing, such as reading quietly with a dim light. 

## 3. Don't use screens

Don’t look at phones, computers or other screens When you feel sleepy again, get back into bed. Don’t sleep in to make up for lost sleep. Avoid reading and watching television in bed.

## 4. Get plenty of exercise. 
Build up to 30 - 45 minutes of moderate exercise nearly every day. Get your exercise early in the day. 
Whenever possible, schedule stressful or demanding tasks early in the day and less challenging activities later. This helps you wind down at the end of your day.

## 5. Don’t go to bed hungry...
But don’t eat a big meal right before getting into bed. If you want a bedtime snack, try to avoid sugar. Favor protein-rich snacks instead.

## 6. Limit caffeine and alcohol consumption

Both caffeine and alcohol can have negative effects on the quality and quantity of sleep we receive. 

## 7. Turn off the lights!
Be sure your bed is comfortable and your bedroom is dark and quiet. Consider a sleep mask or earplugs.

##  8. Don’t take long naps during the day

If you need a nap, restrict it to 20 to 30 minutes in the early afternoon.

## 9. Breathe

Practice relaxation breathing. Use slow breaths, especially when you exhale.

## 10. Don't hang out in bed

Use your bed only for sleep or sex. Don’t sit in bed watching TV or reading,as this will train your brain to associate being in bed with sleeping.
