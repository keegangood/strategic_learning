When we focus too intently for too long, we can reach a point where our brains simply cannot absorb any additional information. We can begin to feel a bit hopeless and to worry that we’ll never understand the material. 

However, this is when we must remember the difference and recognize the benefits of both the **focused** and **diffuse** modes of thinking.

<br>
<br>

<center>
    <h2>Focused Thinking</h2>
</center>

Focused thinking is when the mind concentrates intently on a particular subject. We immerse ourselves in the information and actively expend energy towards learning it.

<br>

<center>
    <h3>Examples of Focused Thinking</h3>
    Writing a paper   <br>   
    Doing a math problem   <br>
    Creating a webpage <br>
</center>

<br>

The longer we keep our brains in focused mode, the more we experience tunnel vision, which makes it harder to think outside-the-box. This phenomenon is known as the *Einstellung Effect* and removes our ability to reset the parameters or premise of a problem and thereby blocks creativity. 

For this reason, **when you’re feeling stuck or frustrated with a topic, it’s best to step back and take a break** to let the diffuse mode of thinking run for a while. 


<br>
<br>

<center>
    <h2>Diffuse Thinking</h2>
</center>

Diffuse thinking looks at the big picture. It allows us to zoom out a bit and approach the subject from the outside in, starting with general concepts rather than more specific ones.

We generally default to this mode of thinking when we’re doing something other than studying so this is why taking regular breaks is so important while learning something new. 

While our conscious minds are relaxed, they are able to make connections across broader areas of the brain and deepen understanding of concepts learned during focused thinking. 

<br>

<center>
    <h3>Examples of Diffuse Thinking</h3>
    Pondering the topic of your paper while doing dishes   <br>   
    Mulling over a math problem while taking a walk   <br>
    Considering how different webpage designs would affect a user's experience <br>
</center>

<br> 
<br> 

Too much diffuse thinking can get in our way as well as it will prevent us from ever getting the details of anything straight. 

We should practice alternating work sessions with frequent breaks to allow ourselves to zoom out a bit from the details and solidify the bigger picture. 

Try to avoid things like social media or watching TV.

Instead, opt for activities that allow the mind to truly wander like walking or meditating.

    <h2>Stages of Learning</h2>
</center>

Learning and memory are often described in terms of three functions: **Acquisition**, **Consolidation** and **Recall**.


<center>
    <h2>Acquisition</h2>
</center>

Acquisition is where **new information is introduced into the brain**. 

In this stage, we actively pay attention to a subject and link it to existing knowledge in order to make the new connection more meaningful, which will make it easier to recall the information later. 

Acquisition can take place in a single learning session, but is usually more effective with multiple, repeated sessions spread out over time.

New information can usually be recalled shortly after it’s acquired, but without repeated exposure to the information, it’s much more difficult to recall after a longer period of time.

<br>

<center>
    <h2>Consolidation</h2>
</center>

Consolidation is the **process of encoding short-term memories into long-term memories**. 

This compression of memories is necessary in order to combine the various bits of data we acquire about a subject and to find the appropriate associations for them in our memory so that they’re easily recalled when needed. 

Consolidation takes place primarily during periods of diffuse thinking or sleep and leaves memories in a more stable and useful form.


<br>

<center>
    <h2>Recall</h2>
</center>

Recall is **the ability to intentionally retrieve information after it’s been committed to memory**. 

How well a memory can be recalled is largely dependent on how many times it’s been encountered in the acquisition stage and how thoroughly it’s been integrated in the consolidation stage. 

However, there are also many other factors that can affect our ability to quickly and accurately recall information, such as quantity and quality of sleep.

<br>

<center>
    <h2>Sleep</h2>
</center>

Modern hypotheses highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of systemic integration. 

During periods of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, our brains process the information we’ve acquired during the day in the form of dreams. In fact, the areas of the brain which are activated during REM sleep are the same areas that are active during acquisition of information, suggesting that REM sleep plays a role in memory consolidation.  

Once we enter the deeper stages of sleep, the memories we’ve processed in our dreams are consolidated further and are associated with existing memories at a much broader level.

## Modes of Thinking

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><span style="font-size:1.3rem">Focused</span></td>
            <td><span style="font-size:1.3rem">Diffuse</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Narrow and specific</td>
            <td>Broad and conceptual</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Methodical</td>
            <td>Meandering</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sharpens facts and details</td>
            <td>Uncovers meaning and connection</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

<br>

Both modes of thinking are equally valuable, but it’s the harmony between them that matters.

### We master the specifics in focused mode and comprehend how everything ties together in the diffuse mode.
